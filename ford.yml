summary:         **Deformation Monitoring Package (DMPACK)** â€“ A software
                 library in Fortran 2018 for automatic deformation monitoring in
                 the Internet of Things on Linux and FreeBSD. **DMPACK** is a
                 scientific monitoring system developed for automated control
                 measurements of buildings, infrastructure, terrain, geodetic
                 nets, and other objects. The software runs on sensor nodes
                 and obtains observation data from arbitrary sensors, like
                 robotic total stations, digital levels, inclinometers, weather
                 stations, or GNSS receivers. The raw sensor data is then
                 processed, stored, and optionally transmitted to a server.

**DMPACK** is a free and open-source software package for IoT-based automatic
deformation monitoring and distributed control measurements in engineering
geodesy and geotechnics. The project is the successor of
[OpenADMS](https://www.dabamos.de/openadms.html), and in active development.

The library and the accompanying programs are written in Fortran 2018, with
some smaller parts in Lua. At the moment, **DMPACK** runs on 64-bit Linux and
FreeBSD only.
