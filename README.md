# Deformation Monitoring Package (DMPACK)

DMPACK is a free and open-source software package for IoT-based automatic
deformation monitoring and distributed control measurements in engineering
geodesy and geotechnics. The project is the successor of
[OpenADMS Node](https://github.com/dabamos/openadms-node),
[OpenADMS Server](https://github.com/dabamos/openadms-server), as well as
[OpenADMS UI](https://github.com/dabamos/openadms-ui), and in active
development.

The library and the accompanying programs are written in Fortran 2018, with
some smaller parts in Lua. At the moment, DMPACK runs on 64-bit Linux and
FreeBSD only.

## Description

DMPACK is a scientific monitoring system developed for automated control
measurements of buildings, infrastructure, terrain, geodetic nets, and other
objects. The software runs on sensor nodes, usually industrial embedded systems
or single-board computers, and obtains observation data from arbitrary sensors,
like robotic total stations, digital levels, inclinometers, weather stations, or
GNSS receivers. The raw sensor data is then processed, stored, and optionally
transmitted to a server. The software package may be used to monitor objects
like:

* bridges, tunnels, dams
* landslides, cliffs, glaciers
* construction sites, mining areas
* churches, monasteries, and other heritage buildings

DMPACK is built around the relational SQLite database for time series and log
storage on client and server. The server component is optional. It is possible
to run DMPACK on clients only, without data distribution. The client-side
inter-process communications are based on POSIX message queues and POSIX
semaphores.

## System Architecture

## Features

DMPACK covers the following tasks:

* command-line argument parsing
* configuration file evaluation
* sensor control (RS-232/422/485, 1-Wire, file system, sub-process)
* regular expression matching
* message passing via POSIX message queues
* inter-process communication via POSIX semaphores
* SQLite database access
* data serialisation (ASCII, CSV, JSON, JSON Lines, HDF5, Fortran 95 Namelist)
* HTTP-RPC API for remote procedure calls
* concurrent data synchronisation between client and server
* distributed logging
* heartbeats
* server-side web applications
* time series plotting
* MQTT connectivity
* Lua scripting
* HTML5 reports
* Atom XML web feeds
* e-mail

## Requirements

DMPACK has the following requirements:

* Linux or FreeBSD operating system
* 64-bit platform (x86-64, AArch64)
* Fortran 2018 and ANSI C compiler

Third-party dependencies have to be present to build and run the software of
this package:

* BLAS
* FastCGI
* Gnuplot
* HDF5
* LAPACK
* libcurl (≥ 8.3.0)
* Lua 5.4
* PCRE2
* SQLite 3 (≥ 3.39.0)
* zlib

On Linux, additional development headers are required for the build step. To
generate the [man pages](adoc/README.md), the [user’s guide](guide/README.md),
and the source code documentation, you will need to install:

* [AsciiDoctor](https://asciidoctor.org/), [Pygments](https://pygments.org/), and
  [pygments.rb](https://rubygems.org/gems/pygments.rb/versions/2.2.0)
* [FORD](https://github.com/Fortran-FOSS-Programmers/ford)

## Installation

The DMPACK library and programs have to be built from source by either executing
the provided Makefile, or by using the
[Fortran Package Manager](https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/).

The DMPACK programs require the shared library `libgfortran.so` if they have
been compiled with GNU Fortran.

### FreeBSD

First, install the build and run-time dependencies:

```
$ doas pkg install databases/sqlite3 devel/git devel/pcre2 devel/pkgconf ftp/curl lang/gcc \
  lang/lua54 math/gnuplot math/lapack science/hdf5 www/fcgi
```

Instead of `math/gnuplot`, you may want to install `math/gnuplot-lite` which
does not depend on X11 (but does not include raster graphic terminals).

In order to generate the man pages and the User’s Guide, install Pygments and
AsciiDoctor:

```
$ doas pkg install devel/rubygem-pygments.rb textproc/rubygem-asciidoctor
```

#### Make

The Git repository has to be cloned recursively. Otherwise, the required
sub-modules will be missing. Then, run the Makefile:

```
$ git clone --depth 1 --recursive https://github.com/dabamos/dmpack
$ cd dmpack/
$ make freebsd
```

You can change the installation prefix with argument `PREFIX` (by default,
`/usr/local`). To install the library and all programs system-wide, run:

```
$ doas make install PREFIX=/usr/local
```

For a debug build with AddressSanitizer (ASan) to detect memory errors, run
instead:

```
$ make freebsd_debug DEBUG="-g -fPIE -ffpe-trap=invalid,zero,overflow -fno-omit-frame-pointer" \
  LDLIBS="-pie -static-libasan -fsanitize=address -fno-omit-frame-pointer"
```

#### Fortran Package Manager

Either clone the repository with Git, or download and unpack the archive of the
[master branch](https://github.com/dabamos/dmpack/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).
Then, run:

```
$ cd dmpack/
$ fpm build --profile release --flag "-D__FreeBSD__ -I/usr/local/include"
$ fpm install
```

The Fortran Package Manager will fetch all third-party dependencies
automatically. The library and programs will be installed to `~/.local` by
default. The configuration and the shared files have to be installed manually.

### Linux

On Debian, install GCC, GNU Fortran, and the build environment:

```
$ sudo apt install gcc gfortran git make pkg-config
```

The third-party dependencies have to be installed with development headers:

```
$ sudo apt install --no-install-recommends libblas-dev liblapack-dev \
  curl libcurl4 libcurl4-openssl-dev libfcgi-bin libfcgi-dev gnuplot \
  libhdf5-dev lua5.4 liblua5.4 liblua5.4-dev libpcre2-8-0 libpcre2-dev \
  sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev zlib1g zlib1g-dev
```

Instead of package `gnuplot`, you can install the no-X11 flavour `gnuplot-nox`
alternatively, if raster image formats are not desired (SVG output only).

#### Make

Clone the DMPACK repository, and execute the Makefile:

```
$ git clone --depth 1 --recursive https://github.com/dabamos/dmpack
$ cd dmpack/
$ make linux
```

Install the library and all programs system-wide:

```
$ sudo make install_linux
```

To install to a custom directory, run:

```
$ sudo make install PREFIX=/opt
```

#### Fortran Package Manager

Support for the Fortran Package Manager on Linux is experimental. Clone or
download the repository, then run:

```
$ cd dmpack/
$ fpm build --profile release --flag "-D__linux__ `pkg-config --cflags hdf5`"
$ fpm install
```

The library and programs will be installed to `~/.local` by default. If the
compilation fails with an error message that `-llua-5.4` cannot be found, update
the build manifests first:

```
$ sed -i "s/lua-5/lua5/g" fpm.toml
$ sed -i "s/lua-5/lua5/g" build/dependencies/fortran-lua54/fpm.toml
```

### Updates

Update the cloned source code repository and its submodules with Git:

```
$ git pull
$ git submodule update --remote
$ make purge
$ make [freebsd|linux]
```

## Library

| Name           | Description            |
|----------------|------------------------|
| `libdmpack.a`  | DMPACK static library. |
| `libdmpack.so` | DMPACK shared library. |

Either link your programs against static library `libdmpack.a`, or `-ldmpack` if
`libdmpack.so` is in your library search path, for example:

```
$ gfortran -o example example.f90 /usr/local/lib/libdmpack.a
```

Depending on which parts of the DMPACK library are used by third-party
applications, additional shared libraries have to be linked.

## Manual Pages

To create all DMPACK man pages from source, run:

```
$ make man
```

The output files are written to `man/`.

## User’s Guide

To convert the [User’s Guide](guide/guide.adoc) from AsciiDoc to HTML, run:

```
$ make guide
```

The result is written to `guide/guide.html`.

## Source Code Documentation

The source code documentation of the DMPACK library has to be created with
[FORD](https://github.com/Fortran-FOSS-Programmers/ford). Install the Python
package with:

```
$ python3 -m pip install -U ford
```

In the DMPACK repository, run:

```
$ make doc
```

The HTML files will be written to directory `doc/`. Open `index.html` in a web
browser.

## Test Programs

The DMPACK test programs are compiled by default. In order to run the RPC API
program `dmtestrpc`, set the hostname and the credentials of the server first:

```
$ export DM_API_HOST="localhost"
$ export DM_API_USERNAME="dummy-node"
$ export DM_API_PASSWORD="secret"
```

The following environment variables have to be set for `dmtestmail`:

```
$ export DM_MAIL_FROM="from@example.com"
$ export DM_MAIL_TO="to@example.com"
$ export DM_MAIL_HOST="example.com"
$ export DM_MAIL_USERNAME="username"
$ export DM_MAIL_PASSWORD="password"
```

The program `dmtestmqtt` requires host and port of the MQTT server:

```
$ export DM_MQTT_HOST="localhost"
$ export DM_MQTT_PORT="1883"
```

If not set, the affected tests will be skipped. You may want to set the
variables permanently in `runtest.sh`. Run all test programs with:

```
$ sh runtests.sh
```

To write the test protocols to file, disable coloured output first by setting
the environment variable `NO_COLOR`:

```
$ export NO_COLOR=
$ sh runtests.sh &> tests.log
```
