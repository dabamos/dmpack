This is the source code documentation of the DMPACK library. Import module
`dmpack` to access any of the procedures in the library:

```fortran
! app.f90
program main
    use :: dmpack
    implicit none (type, external)

    ! Initialise DMPACK.
    call dm_init()

    ! Call any DMPACK procedures here.
    ! ...
end program main
```

Link the program against `libdmpack.a`:

```
$ gfortran -o app app.f90 libdmpack.a
```

You may have to pass the path of the include search directory containing the
DMPACK module files (argument `-I`).
