.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The \fBdmpipe\fP program reads responses from a process connected via anonymous
pipe.
.sp
Each request of an observation must contain the process to execute in attribute
\f(CRrequest\fP. Response values are extracted by group from the raw response using
the provided regular expression pattern. A response has to be added for each
group in the pattern. The response name must equal the group name.
.sp
If any receivers are specified, observations are forwarded to the next receiver
via POSIX message queue. The program can act as a sole data logger if output and
format are set. If the output path is set to \f(CR\-\fP, observations are printed to
\fIstdout\fP.
.sp
A configuration file is required to configure the jobs to perform. Each
observation must have a valid target id. The database must contain
node, sensor, and target of all observations configured.
